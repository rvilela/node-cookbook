## Markdown Preview

A [Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets) extension that provides a live preview of markdown documents. 

### Installation

* [Download the Zip](https://github.com/gruehle/MarkdownPreview/archive/master.zip) and unzip it; or clone this repo on GitHub.
* From Brackets, choose _Help > Show Extensions Folder_. This will open the extensions folder.
* Drag the unzipped (or cloned) folder into the `user` directory.
* Restart Brackets.

### How To Use
When a markdown document (with extension ".md" or ".markdown") is open, a markdown icon is shown in the 
toolbar at the top of the Brackets window. Click this icon to open the preview panel. The panel can be 
resized vertically.

The preview is updated as you edit the document. You can hover over links to see the href in a tooltip.
